# Multi-Robot Systems & Coordination

## Overview

This week focuses on multi-robot systems and coordination algorithms. Students will learn to design and implement systems with multiple robots working together, develop communication protocols for robot coordination, and implement distributed algorithms for collaborative tasks. This week builds upon the control and trajectory planning knowledge from previous weeks to create coordinated multi-robot behaviors and systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Design and implement multi-robot communication architectures
- Develop coordination algorithms for collaborative tasks
- Implement distributed consensus and decision-making algorithms
- Create formation control and swarm robotics systems
- Design task allocation and scheduling systems for multi-robot teams
- Evaluate multi-robot system performance and scalability

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-5 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Understanding of single robot control systems
- Experience with ROS 2 communication patterns
- Knowledge of basic networking concepts
- Understanding of distributed systems principles

## Topics Covered

- Multi-robot communication architectures
- Coordination and consensus algorithms
- Formation control and swarm robotics

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 4 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 6 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Working Week 1-5 ROS 2 workspace

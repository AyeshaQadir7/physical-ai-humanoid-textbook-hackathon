# Week 2: Robot Operating Systems and ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

This week focuses on mastering the core concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the essential framework for robot software development. Students will dive deep into ROS 2 architecture, understand nodes, topics, services, actions, and implement basic robot control interfaces. This week builds upon the foundational knowledge from Week 1 and establishes the software infrastructure needed for all subsequent modules.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 core concepts: nodes, topics, services, actions
- Create and configure ROS 2 launch files and parameter management
- Implement custom message types and services
- Design multi-node robot systems with proper communication patterns
- Debug ROS 2 communication using tools like rqt and ros2 command line tools
- Understand TF (Transforms) and coordinate systems for robot navigation

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1 or equivalent ROS 2 basics knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Basic Python or C++ programming skills
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts

## Topics Covered

- Deep dive into ROS 2 architecture
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- ROS 2 launch files and parameter management
- TF (Transforms) and coordinate systems
- ROS 2 command line tools and debugging

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 4 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 6 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Working Week 1 ROS 2 workspace
- Text editor or IDE for code development
- Terminal access for ROS 2 commands

## Week Structure

This week is organized into the following sections:
1. [Theory](./theory.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Lab Exercise](./lab-exercise.md) - Hands-on implementation
3. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Knowledge validation

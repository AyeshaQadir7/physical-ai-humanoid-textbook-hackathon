# Human-Robot Interaction & Social Robotics

## Overview

This week focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Social Robotics, exploring how robots can effectively communicate and interact with humans in natural and intuitive ways. Students will learn about social robotics principles, natural communication modalities, and design considerations for robots that work alongside humans. This week builds upon the integration and deployment knowledge from Week 8, focusing specifically on the human-centered aspects of robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand principles of human-robot interaction and social robotics
- Design natural communication interfaces for robots (speech, gesture, facial expressions)
- Implement social behaviors that enhance human-robot collaboration
- Apply ethical considerations in social robotics design
- Evaluate human-robot interaction quality and user experience
- Develop robots that can adapt to different user preferences and contexts

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-8 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Understanding of robot integration and deployment concepts
- Experience with perception and control systems
- Basic knowledge of psychology and human factors
- Understanding of user interface design principles

## Topics Covered

- Principles of human-robot interaction
- Natural communication modalities (speech, gesture, vision)
- Social robotics and robot personalities
- Ethical considerations in HRI
- User experience design for robots
- Adaptive interaction systems
- Safety in human-robot collaboration

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 4 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 6 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Working Week 1-8 ROS 2 workspace
- Robot platform with speech, vision, and display capabilities
- Microphone and speaker for audio interaction
- Camera for gesture and facial recognition
- Text editor or IDE for development

## Week Structure

This week is organized into the following sections:
1. [Theory](./theory.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Lab Exercise](./lab-exercise.md) - Hands-on implementation
3. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Knowledge validation

Let's explore the fascinating world of human-robot interaction and social robotics!

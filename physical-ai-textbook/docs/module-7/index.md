# Machine Learning for Robotics

## Overview

This week focuses on machine learning techniques applied to robotics problems. Students will learn to implement perception algorithms using deep learning, develop learning-based control systems, and apply reinforcement learning for robot decision making. This week builds upon the multi-robot coordination knowledge from previous weeks to create intelligent robot systems that can learn and adapt to their environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Implement deep learning models for robot perception tasks
- Apply reinforcement learning algorithms for robot control
- Develop learning-based navigation and path planning systems
- Use imitation learning for robot skill acquisition
- Integrate machine learning models with ROS 2 systems
- Evaluate and validate machine learning models in robotic applications

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-6 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Understanding of basic machine learning concepts
- Experience with Python programming
- Knowledge of robot perception and control systems
- Basic understanding of neural networks

## Topics Covered

- Deep learning for robot perception
- Reinforcement learning for robotics
- Imitation learning and behavioral cloning
- Learning-based control systems

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 4 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 6 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed

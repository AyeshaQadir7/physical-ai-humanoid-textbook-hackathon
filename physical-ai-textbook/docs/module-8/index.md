# Integration & Deployment

## Overview

This week focuses on integrating all the components learned in previous weeks into complete robotic systems and deploying them in real-world scenarios. Students will learn to combine perception, control, navigation, multi-robot coordination, and machine learning systems into cohesive applications. This week serves as a capstone experience, bringing together all the knowledge from the previous weeks to create deployable robotic solutions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Integrate multiple robotic subsystems into cohesive applications
- Design and implement complete robotic workflows
- Deploy robotic systems in real-world environments
- Optimize system performance and resource utilization
- Implement monitoring, logging, and debugging strategies
- Evaluate system reliability and maintainability

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-7 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Understanding of all previous week topics
- Experience with ROS 2 launch files and system composition
- Knowledge of system architecture and software engineering principles
- Understanding of hardware integration and real robot operation

## Topics Covered

- System integration and architecture
- Real-world deployment strategies
- Performance optimization and profiling
- System monitoring and diagnostics
- Hardware integration and calibration
- Testing and validation methodologies
- Maintenance and update procedures

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 3 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 7 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Working Week 1-7 ROS 2 workspace
- Robot platform (physical or simulated)
- Hardware components for integration (sensors, actuators)
- Network and communication equipment
- Performance monitoring tools
- Debugging and profiling utilities

## Week Structure

This week is organized into the following sections:
1. [Theory](./theory.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Lab Exercise](./lab-exercise.md) - Hands-on implementation
3. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Knowledge validation

Let's bring together everything we've learned to create complete, deployable robotic systems!

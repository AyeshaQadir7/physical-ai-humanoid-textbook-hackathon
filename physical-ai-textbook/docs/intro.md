# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive, college-level technical textbook that educates students in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics through hands-on learning experiences. This textbook guides learners through the complete development lifecycle of humanoid robots using modern tools and frameworks including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

## About This Textbook

This curriculum follows a structured weekly module breakdown that progresses from foundational concepts to a capstone autonomous humanoid project. Each week culminates in a functional robot subsystem that contributes to a larger humanoid robot project, incorporating hardware requirements, laboratory exercises, assessments, and visual diagrams to ensure deep understanding and practical competency.

## What You'll Learn

- **Physical AI Fundamentals**: Understanding the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical systems
- **Robot Operating Systems**: Mastering ROS 2 for robot development and control
- **Simulation Environments**: Working with Gazebo for realistic robot simulation
- **Advanced Visualization**: Using Unity for AR/VR integration and advanced visualization
- **Accelerated AI Computing**: Leveraging NVIDIA Isaac for high-performance robotics AI
- **Multimodal AI Systems**: Implementing Vision-Language-Action systems for intelligent robots
- **Hardware Integration**: Bridging the gap between simulation and physical implementation
- **Voice-to-Action Systems**: Creating natural interfaces for robot control
- **Safety-First Development**: Implementing fail-safe mechanisms and risk assessment

## Prerequisites

This textbook is designed to accommodate learners with minimal robotics background while providing sufficient depth for intermediate students. Basic programming knowledge is recommended, particularly in Python and C++. Familiarity with Linux command line and version control systems like Git will be beneficial.

## Weekly Structure

The curriculum is organized into 12 weekly modules, each building upon the previous to create increasingly sophisticated robot capabilities:

2. **Module 2**: Robot Operating Systems and ROS 2 Fundamentals
1. **Module 1**: Introduction to Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
1. **Module 3**: Robot Perception and Sensor Integration
1. **Module 4**: Robot Simulation with Gazebo
1. **Module 5**: Motion Planning and Control
1. **Module 6**: Unity Integration for Advanced Visualization
1. **Module 7**: NVIDIA Isaac for Accelerated AI Computing
1. **Module 8**: Vision-Language-Action Systems
1. **Module 9**: Voice-to-Action Integration
1. **Module 10**: Hardware-Software Co-Design
1. **Module 11**: Advanced Control and Learning
1. **Module 12**: Capstone Autonomous Humanoid Project

## Getting Started

Each module includes:

- Theoretical foundations with practical applications
- Step-by-step laboratory exercises
- Comprehensive assessments
- Hardware integration guides
- Safety considerations

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational knowledge required for the subsequent modules. Each module is designed to be self-contained while contributing to the larger humanoid robot project.

## Open Source & Reproducible

All code, hardware designs, documentation, and educational materials are open-source and fully reproducible. Students should be able to replicate every project using publicly available components and tools. The textbook promotes collaborative learning and community contributions through accessible GitHub repositories and clear contribution guidelines.

# Robot Perception and Sensor Integration

## Overview

This week focuses on robot perception systems and sensor integration, essential components for any autonomous robot. Students will learn to integrate various sensors into ROS 2 systems, process sensor data for perception tasks, and implement basic computer vision with OpenCV. This week builds upon the communication foundations from Week 2 and introduces the sensory capabilities that enable robots to understand their environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Integrate various sensors into ROS 2 systems using appropriate message types
- Process sensor data for perception tasks using ROS 2 tools
- Implement basic computer vision algorithms with OpenCV and ROS 2
- Work with point cloud data for 3D perception
- Use visualization tools like Rviz to understand sensor data
- Design sensor fusion approaches for improved perception

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1 and Week 2 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Basic understanding of Python and OpenCV
- Understanding of ROS 2 communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Basic linear algebra knowledge for transformations

## Topics Covered

- Sensor types and integration (cameras, LIDAR, IMU, etc.)
- Sensor data processing pipelines
- Introduction to computer vision with OpenCV and ROS 2
- Point cloud processing and visualization
- Sensor fusion concepts
- Rviz for sensor data visualization

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 4 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 6 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Working Week 1-2 ROS 2 workspace
- OpenCV installed (usually included with ROS 2)
- Sample sensor data or simulated sensors
- Text editor or IDE for code development

## Week Structure

This week is organized into the following sections:
1. [Theory](./theory.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Lab Exercise](./lab-exercise.md) - Hands-on implementation
3. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Knowledge validation

Let's explore the fascinating world of robot perception and sensor integration!

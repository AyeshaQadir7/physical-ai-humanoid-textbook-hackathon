# Week 4: Robot Simulation with Gazebo

## Overview

This week focuses on robot simulation using Gazebo, a powerful 3D simulation environment for robotics. Students will learn to create detailed robot models for simulation, implement realistic physics and sensor models, and design simulation environments for testing. This week builds upon the perception and sensor integration knowledge from Week 3 and introduces the essential tools for safe and cost-effective robot development and testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Create detailed robot models for simulation using URDF/XACRO
- Implement realistic physics models and Gazebo plugins for robot simulation
- Design simulation environments that accurately represent real-world scenarios
- Integrate sensors into simulated robots with realistic models
- Use Gazebo tools for robot testing and validation
- Connect simulated robots to ROS 2 using the Gazebo-ROS bridge

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-3 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Understanding of robot kinematics and dynamics
- Basic knowledge of XML/URDF for robot modeling
- Understanding of ROS 2 communication patterns

## Topics Covered

- Robot model description (URDF/XACRO)
- Gazebo physics engine and plugins
- Sensor simulation and realistic modeling
- Environment design and world creation
- Gazebo-ROS 2 integration
- Simulation-based testing and validation

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 4 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 6 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 12 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Gazebo Garden (or compatible version) installed
- Working Week 1-3 ROS 2 workspace
- Text editor or IDE for XML/URDF editing

## Week Structure

This week is organized into the following sections:
1. [Theory](./theory.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Lab Exercise](./lab-exercise.md) - Hands-on implementation
3. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Knowledge validation

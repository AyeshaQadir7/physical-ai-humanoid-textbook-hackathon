# Week 5: Advanced Control Systems & Trajectory Planning

## Overview

This week focuses on advanced control systems and trajectory planning for robotics. Students will learn to design and implement sophisticated control algorithms for robot motion, develop trajectory planning techniques for complex movements, and integrate control systems with perception and navigation. This week builds upon the simulation and navigation knowledge from previous weeks to create more sophisticated robot behaviors and movements.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Design and implement PID and advanced control algorithms for robot motion
- Plan and execute complex trajectories with smooth transitions
- Implement feedback control systems for precise robot positioning
- Integrate control systems with perception and navigation modules
- Design adaptive control systems that respond to environmental changes
- Evaluate control system performance and stability

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-4 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation

# Week 12: Project Development & Capstone

## Overview

This capstone week brings together all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the robotics curriculum. Students will design, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive robotic system that integrates multiple concepts from previous weeks. This project serves as the culmination of the course, demonstrating proficiency in physical AI, humanoid robotics, ROS 2 development, perception, control, learning, human-robot interaction, and field applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Integrate multiple robotics subsystems into a cohesive application
- Apply design thinking to complex robotic system development
- Implement a complete robotic solution addressing real-world challenges
- Evaluate and validate robotic systems using appropriate metrics
- Document and present robotic system designs effectively
- Demonstrate professional project management skills in robotics

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-11 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation
- Understanding of all previous robotics concepts
- Experience with system integration and deployment
- Knowledge of project management principles
- Ability to work independently on complex projects

## Topics Covered

- System design and architecture
- Project planning and management
- Requirements analysis and specification
- System integration and testing
- Performance evaluation and validation
- Documentation and presentation
- Professional communication skills

## Time Allocation

- Theoretical concepts: 2 hours
- Hands-on lab exercises: 18 hours
- Assessment: 2 hours
- Total: 22 hours

## Materials Needed

- Computer with ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installed
- Complete Week 1-11 ROS 2 workspace
- Robot simulation environment or physical robot
- Development tools and libraries from previous weeks
- Project planning and documentation tools
- Version control system (Git)
- Testing and evaluation frameworks

## Week Structure

This week is organized into the following sections:
1. [Theory](./theory.md) - Core concepts and principles
2. [Lab Exercise](./lab-exercise.md) - Hands-on implementation
3. [Assessment](./assessment.md) - Knowledge validation

Let's synthesize all our knowledge into a comprehensive capstone project!

# Week 11: Field Robotics & Real-World Applications

## Overview

This week focuses on field robotics applications and the challenges of deploying robotic systems in real-world environments outside of controlled laboratory settings. Students will learn about specialized robotics for agriculture, construction, mining, marine, space, and other field applications. This week builds upon all previous knowledge to address the unique challenges of operating robots in unstructured, dynamic, and often harsh real-world environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand the unique challenges of field robotics compared to lab robotics
- Design robotic systems for specific field applications (agriculture, construction, etc.)
- Address environmental challenges such as weather, terrain, and lighting
- Implement robust perception and navigation for unstructured environments
- Develop maintenance and reliability strategies for field deployment
- Evaluate field robotics systems in real-world scenarios

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1-10 or equivalent knowledge
- Working ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill installation

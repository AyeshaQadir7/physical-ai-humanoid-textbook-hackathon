# Textbook Architecture Decisions

## Outcome
Created three Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting the key architectural decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook: technology stack, content organization, and quality standards approach.

## Evaluation
The ADRs document architecturally significant decisions with:
- Clear context and rationale for each decision
- Alternative approaches considered
- Positive and negative consequences
- References to related planning documents
- Proper status and date tracking

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Created three ADRs documenting key architectural decisions: 1) Technology stack (Docusaurus + GitHub Pages + Spec-Kit Plus), 2) Content organization (modular, week-by-week structure with four core modules), 3) Quality standards (accuracy, clarity, consistency, and formatting requirements).

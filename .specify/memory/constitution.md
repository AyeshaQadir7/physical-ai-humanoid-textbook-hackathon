# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Vision

To create a comprehensive, college-level technical textbook that educates students in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics through hands-on learning experiences. This textbook will guide learners through the complete development lifecycle of humanoid robots using modern tools and frameworks including ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems. The curriculum will follow a structured weekly module breakdown that progresses from foundational concepts to a capstone autonomous humanoid project, incorporating hardware requirements, laboratory exercises, assessments, and visual diagrams to ensure deep understanding and practical competency.

## Core Principles

### I. Hands-On Learning First
Every concept must be grounded in practical exercises and real-world applications using industry-standard tools. Theoretical explanations should immediately connect to tangible projects that students can build, modify, and experiment with using ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA systems. All chapters must include step-by-step tutorials, code examples, and hardware assembly guides that learners can follow with accessible components.

### II. Project-Driven Understanding with Weekly Modules
Learning progresses through a structured weekly breakdown of modules that build upon each other. Each week culminates in a functional robot subsystem that contributes to a larger humanoid robot project. Students learn by creating working prototypes, debugging real issues, and iterating on their designs rather than passively consuming content. The curriculum follows the hackathon specification's module structure.

### III. Beginner-to-Intermediate Accessibility with Technical Depth (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Content must be structured to accommodate learners with minimal robotics background while providing sufficient depth for intermediate students. Each chapter includes prerequisite knowledge assessment, clear learning objectives, and multiple complexity levels for exercises. Mathematical concepts are introduced with intuitive explanations before formal definitions. The content must be suitable for a college-level technical curriculum.

### IV. Multi-Framework Integration and Technology Stack Mastery
The textbook provides comprehensive coverage of essential robotics technologies: ROS 2 for robot operating systems, Gazebo for simulation, Unity for advanced visualization and AR/VR integration, NVIDIA Isaac for accelerated AI computing, and Vision-Language-Action systems for multimodal AI. Students must gain proficiency in all these frameworks as specified in the hackathon requirements.

### V. Hardware-Software Co-Design and Real-World Implementation
All content must bridge the gap between simulation and physical implementation. Students learn to design systems that work in both simulated environments (Gazebo/Unity) and with actual hardware components. Hardware requirements, component selection, and integration challenges are addressed alongside software development throughout all modules.

### VI. Open-Source and Reproducible Learning with Docusaurus Compatibility
All code, hardware designs, documentation, and educational materials must be open-source and fully reproducible. Content is structured as markdown files compatible with Docusaurus for deployment to GitHub Pages. Students should be able to replicate every project using publicly available components and tools. The textbook promotes collaborative learning and community contributions through accessible GitHub repositories and clear contribution guidelines.

### VII. Lab-Centric Learning with Assessments and Visual Aids
Every module must include structured laboratory exercises, comprehensive assessments, and detailed diagrams (with text descriptions) that support visual learning. Labs provide hands-on experience with the technologies, while assessments validate understanding. Diagrams must be created in formats compatible with Docusaurus documentation generation.

### VIII. Safety-First Development and Voice-to-Action Integration
Every practical exercise incorporates safety considerations and risk assessment. Students learn to identify potential hazards, implement safety measures, and develop fail-safe mechanisms. The curriculum includes Voice-to-Action systems integration as specified in the hackathon requirements, with emphasis on safe and reliable voice command processing.

## Success Criteria

- Students can successfully complete all weekly modules and build functional humanoid robot subsystems
- 80% of students can implement ROS 2 nodes, Gazebo simulations, and Unity visualizations independently
- Students demonstrate proficiency with NVIDIA Isaac and VLA systems through capstone project
- Course completion rate exceeds 70% for college-level learners
- Students complete hardware integration projects successfully
- Community engagement: active GitHub contributions, issue resolution, and student project showcases
- Content remains current with evolving robotics technologies and standards
- All content successfully deploys via Docusaurus to GitHub Pages

## Constraints

- Target audience: College-level technical curriculum (beginners to intermediate learners)
- Technology stack: Docusaurus for documentation, GitHub Pages for deployment, Spec-Kit Plus for planning, Claude Code for development
- Required technologies: ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA systems, Voice-to-Action, Capstone Autonomous Humanoid
- Hardware components: must be specified with clear requirements and commercially available options
- Software tools: must be cross-platform and include free/open-source alternatives
- Content structure: must follow weekly module breakdown from hackathon specification
- Lab requirements: each module must include hands-on laboratory exercises
- Assessment requirements: comprehensive evaluations for each module
- Diagram requirements: text descriptions and visual aids for all complex concepts
- Deployment: must work reliably on GitHub Pages with Docusaurus
- Accessibility: content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for inclusive learning

## Brand Voice

The textbook speaks with an authoritative yet approachable technical voice. Content is precise and educational, using clear explanations for complex robotics concepts while maintaining technical rigor. The tone is encouraging and empowering for college-level learners, acknowledging that robotics is challenging but achievable through systematic learning. Language is inclusive and avoids unnecessary jargon without sacrificing technical accuracy. The voice emphasizes practical application, experimentation, and the integration of multiple complex technologies. Content maintains consistency across all modules and follows a modular, structured approach suitable for both self-paced and instructor-led learning.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the textbook development process. All content, code, exercises, labs, assessments, and diagrams must align with these principles. Changes to this constitution require community review and approval through the project's established governance process. All contributors must acknowledge and adhere to these principles when participating in development. The constitution enforces strict consistency, structure, and completeness across all chapters to ensure a unified textbook repo deployable via GitHub Pages.
